# Server Rules

These are the official rules governing conduct on Static Studios, including both our Minecraft server and Discord
community. By accessing any part of our network, including participating in gameplay, chat, events, or communication
platforms, you agree to follow these rules. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, including but not
limited to mutes, kicks, bans, or permanent removal from the server.

Rules are subject to change at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to remain up to date with
current rules. Enforcement of rules may vary depending on context, severity, and staff discretion.

### Chat Behavior

Players are expected to be respectful and considerate in all forms of communication, including public chat and direct
messages. Disrespectful behavior such as spamming, flooding the chat, hate speech, harassment, or personal attacks will
not be tolerated. This includes threats of violence, threats of self-harm, or engaging in excessive toxicity toward
other players.

Disruption in direct messages (DMs) is also considered a violation, especially if it is unwanted or aggressive in
nature. Impersonating staff members, sharing or promoting NSFW content, and posting unrelated or unsafe links—especially
those not connected to Static Studios—are strictly forbidden.

### Modified Clients and Allowed Mods

You are allowed to use modified clients provided they do not offer any gameplay advantage over other players. Mods that
improve performance or aesthetics are generally permitted. For example, you may use Optifine, basic minimap mods (that
do not reveal entities or caves), HUD customizers, and shader packs. These modifications enhance visual experience
without altering gameplay mechanics.

However, any client or mod that gives an unfair advantage is not allowed. Disallowed modifications include, but are not
limited to, X-Ray or resource detection tools, aim assists, aimbots, auto fishing, movement or speed
hacks, and pathing/farming bots. These create imbalances in gameplay and will result in penalties if used.

### Server Bugs and Exploits

If you discover a bug or exploit, you are required to report it immediately to a member of the staff. Intentionally
exploiting a bug, glitch, or unintended mechanic will result in disciplinary action. This includes duplication glitches
and any form of behavior that circumvents intended gameplay mechanics.

Additionally, if a bug causes server lag or performance degradation, it must not be abused. These issues also need to be
reported promptly so they can be addressed. Continued abuse of performance-impacting bugs is considered a form of
exploitation.

### Real World Trades

Trading in-game items, services, or currency for real-world goods or money is strictly prohibited. All transactions must
remain within the Static Studios environment. This means you may not pay or accept payment in any form of real-world
currency—including PayPal, gift cards, or cryptocurrency—for anything that affects in-game gameplay or resources.

### Boosting

Players/teams are not allowed to boost other players or teams in any way which gives a competitive advantage. It is okay
in moderation, but boosting players for seasonal rewards is not allowed and will result in both parties being
disqualified from the seasonal rewards.

### Alt Accounts

Players are allowed to use alternate accounts on the server, but there are specific restrictions. You may not use auto
clickers, macros, or other automation tools on alt accounts. Furthermore, using alts to exploit mechanics, perform
duplication glitches, or otherwise gain an unfair advantage is not permitted.

You may not use an alt account to grind skills and claim additional rewards, which gives an unfair advantage.

Each account should be used in a way that does not abuse server mechanics or bypass limitations intended for
single-player use.

You may use an alt account to AFK on the server for spawners.

All of your accounts MUST be members of the same Skyblock island.

You are allowed to have up to 5 alt account.

### AFK Clicking and Macros

AFK auto clicking is allowed on the server. However, the use of macros—defined as scripts or automation that performs
chains of actions or complex input sequences—is strictly disallowed. Macros often provide advantages that go beyond what
a player could reasonably achieve manually and are therefore not acceptable in any form.

### English Only

All communication on the server, including in-game chat, Discord chat, and any other text or voice chats, must be
conducted in English. This ensures that our team
can effectively moderate and assist all players.

### Staff Authority and Enforcement

Staff members have the final say in all rule interpretations and enforcement decisions. Not all disruptive or harmful
behaviors can be anticipated or explicitly listed, so players are expected to use common sense at all times.

In cases where behavior is harmful or exploitative, a punishment may still be issued even if no specific rule was
broken. The rules are designed to be a guideline, and the staff reserves the right to act in the best interest of the
community.

### Scamming

Scamming is strictly prohibited on the server. This includes any form of deception or trickery to gain items, currency,
or other in-game advantages from other players. Insiding or betraying a team for personal gain is also considered
scamming and will not be tolerated.
