Author: Sam (Founder of Static Studios)

## Overview

Static Skyblock is a custom cross-play Skyblock server. It is the first season of Static Skyblock,
and it is packed with features. Static Skyblock is a project that has been in the works for over a year, and we are
excited to finally share it with the world. The goal of Static Skyblock is to provide a unique and engaging Skyblock
experience that is both fun and challenging, check out the features below to see what we have to offer!

## A Brief History of Static Studios

Feel free to skip this section.

Static Studios, formerly known as Static Network, was founded in 2019. Static Studios used to create Minecraft Realms on
Minecraft Bedrock Edition - the goal back then was to bring a server-like experience to the console community. Static
Studios successfully maintained the following gamemodes for a few years: Skyblock, Prisons, Factions & Kit PvP. In 2021,
Static Studios made a comeback with Static Prisons, an attempt at a Java server. Static Prisons was a mild success, but
the project was killed in 2022. Static Prisons was made as a hobby project - my main goal with the project was to
teach myself how to code, as the aforementioned Realms used command blocks to function. I was successful in learning to
code, but due to my lack of experience, the project's codebase was an unmaintainable mess.

In April of last year, I was wrapping up the second semester of my freshman year in college. I wanted a project to work
on for fun over the Summer, so me and Noah (team member, developer) began working on Static Skyblock. At the time, it
was just a "for fun" project - we weren't planning on launching it. Similar to Static Prisons, my goal with the project
was to learn more about software development. A few months in, we came to the conclusion that we put in too much work
not to release it, so we gave it our all and tried to create the best Skyblock that two busy developers possibly could.

This project is very different to anything I've created in the past. We invested a lot (like, a lot a lot) of time into
getting the project's architecture right - and it's already paying off. In summary, this means that we can provide many
content-packed updates, without limitations. That's enough yap for now, go look at what you actually care about. See
what features Static Skyblock has to offer below!

## Features

This section covers the main features of Skyblock.

### Skills

Skills are a solo feature. Skills are the main way that you will progress through Skyblock, as a player. There are four
different skills: grinding, mining, farming, and fishing. You can level up your grinding skill by killing mobs. You can
level up your mining skill by mining in the `/mine`. You can level up your farming skill by harvesting crops at your
`/island`. You can level up your fishing skill by fishing at `/fishing`.

Each time one of your skills level up, you will be give a reward. As you make your way into the higher skill levels, the
rewards will get better and better. Eventually you'll hit your skills max level, at this point you can prestige.
Prestiging a skill will set you back to level 0, but your max level is now higher - meaning you can get better rewards.
You're able to reclaim all the rewards as you level up your skill again. In addition to getting more rewards, prestiging
also gives you prestige points. Prestige points can be used in the prestige `/shop` to purchase exclusive items.

Pets are a great way to speed up the skill leveling process. Not only do they give you a skill XP boost, but pets can be
upgraded to give additional rewards such as crate keys, tokens, and more! As you level up your pet, they'll give you a
higher skill XP boost. If you're not happy with your pet, you can `/salvage` it for tokens.

### Enchantments

The vanilla enchantment system has been completely overhauled. For started, enchantment books are obtained from skill
rewards, crates, the token shop, and other various sources. Each enchantment book has a success rate and a destroy rate.
The success rate refers to the chance that the enchantment will successfully apply to an item. The destroy rate refers
to the chance that your item will be broken in the process of applying this enchantment, regardless of if it
successfully applies or not. Don't worry - broken items can be repaired at the cost of experience. When you apply an
enchantment book, you get to choose how many levels to spend. The more levels you spend, the higher the chance of
success.

If you're not happy with an enchantment, `/salvage` it for tokens!

Each mine contains different treasures that you'll find as you mine. Unlock better mines by leveling up your mining
`/skill`. Access the mines with `/mine`.

### Fishing

Fishing is a great way to earn money. See what fish there are with `/fishing`.

### Island Leveling, Island Quests, Island Points & Island Upgrades

Leveling up your island is the main way to progress in Skyblock, as a team. Earn XP for your island by grinding mobs,
mining, fishing or farming. Each time you level up your island, you will be rewarded with an island point. You can also
earn island points by completing `/island quest`s. Island points
are spent to unlock island upgrades. Some island upgrades cost money as well as island points.

**Island Upgrades:**

- Island Member Limit: Allow more people to join your island
- Crop Growth Speed: Increase how fast crops grow on your island
- Island Border Size: Increase the size of your island
- Chunk Hopper Limit: Increase how many chunk hoppers can be placed on your island

- Unlimited Flight: Allow everyone on your island to fly without limits

### Island Value & Island Top

Going old school, you're island's value is based off of value blocks. Value blocks must be placed down on your island to
count towards your island's value. Island values can be purchased from the `/shop` or they can be obtained from
`/crates` or the `/mine`s. In addition to island value blocks, spawners will also contribute value towards your island.

Island top is based solely off of island value. View the leaderboard with `/island top`.

### Hoppers & Chunk Hoppers

We've overhauled vanilla hoppers. You cannot craft hoppers, they much be purchased from the `/shop` or won from
`/crates`. There are different tiers of hoppers, each moving a greater amount of items per second, up to 800 items/sec.
Chunk hoppers behave similar to hoppers, but they will automatically pick up any item in the chunk that they're placed
in. Chunk hoppers are also tiered. You can customize what chunk hoppers pick up via `/island settings`.

### Ranks

There are five ranks with distinct perks.
