# Skyblock Season 1.0 is here ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Author: Sam (Founder of Static Studios)

## Overview

Welcome to the first season of Static Skyblock, a custom, cross-play Skyblock server packed with features! Static
Skyblock is a project that has been in the works for over a year, and we are
excited to finally share it with the world. The goal of Static Skyblock is to provide a unique and engaging Skyblock
experience that is both fun and challenging. Check out the features below to see what we have to offer!

## A Brief History of Static Studios

Feel free to skip this section.

Static Studios, formerly known as Static Network, was founded in 2019. Static Studios used to create Realms on
Minecraft Bedrock Edition with the goal to bring a server-like experience to the console community. Static
Studios successfully maintained the following gamemodes for a few years: Skyblock, Prisons, Factions, and Kit PvP. In
2021,
Static Studios made a comeback with Static Prisons, an attempt at a Java Edition server. Static Prisons was a mild
success, but
the project was killed in 2022. Static Prisons was made as a hobby project-- with the main goal to teach myself how to
code.

In April of 2024, I was wrapping up the second semester of my freshman year in college. I wanted a project to work
on for fun over the Summer, so Noah, a member of the development team, and I began working on Static Skyblock. At the
time, this project was just "for fun" and we had no intentions of making it public. Similar to Static Prisons, my goal
with the project
was to learn more about software development. A couple months into the project we decided to try our hardest and release
the best Skyblock that two busy developers possibly could.

This project is very different to anything I've created in the past. We invested a lot (like, a lot a lot) of time into
getting the project's architecture right and it's already paying off. In summary, this means that we can provide many
content-packed updates without any limitations! That's enough yapping for now, go read what you actually care about, see
what features Static Skyblock has to offer below!

## Features

This section covers the main features of Skyblock.

### Skills

Skills are a solo feature and are the main way that you will progress through Skyblock as a player. There are four
different skills: grinding, mining, farming, and fishing.

- Level up your grinding skill by killing mobs.
- Level up your mining skill by mining in the `/mine`.
- Level up your farming skill by harvesting crops at your `/island`.
- Level up your fishing skill by fishing at /fishing.

Each time one of your skills level up, you will be give a reward. As you make your way into the higher skill levels, the
rewards will get better and better. Eventually, you will hit your skill's maximum level and you can prestige.
Prestiging a skill will set you back to level 0, but increase your max level - meaning you can get better rewards.
You're able to reclaim all the rewards as you level up your skill again. In addition to getting more rewards, prestiging
also gives you prestige points. Prestige points can be used in the prestige `/shop` to purchase exclusive items.

Pets are a great way to speed up the skill leveling process. Not only do they give you a skill XP boost, but pets can be
upgraded to give additional rewards such as crate keys, tokens, and more! As you level up your pet, they'll give you a
higher skill XP boost. If you're not happy with your pet, you can `/salvage` it for tokens.

### Enchantments

The vanilla enchantment system has been completely overhauled. For starters, enchantment books are obtained from skill
rewards, crates, the token shop, and other various sources. Each enchantment book has a success rate and a destroy rate.
The success rate refers to the chance that the enchantment will successfully apply to an item. The destroy rate refers
to the chance that your item will be broken in the process of applying this enchantment regardless whether it
successfully applies or not. Don't worry - broken items can be repaired at the cost of experience. When you apply an
enchantment book, you get to choose how many levels to spend. The more levels you spend, the higher the chance of
success.

If you're not happy with an enchantment, `/salvage` it for tokens!

Each mine contains different treasures that you'll find as you mine. Unlock better mines by leveling up your mining
`/skill`. Access the mines with `/mine`.

### Fishing

Fishing is a great way to earn money. See what fish there are with `/fishing`.

### Island Leveling, Island Quests, Island Points & Island Upgrades

Leveling up your island is the main way to progress in Skyblock, as a team. Earn XP for your island by grinding mobs,
mining, fishing or farming. Each time you level up your island, you will be rewarded with an island point. You can also
earn island points by completing `/island quest`s. Island points
are spent to unlock island upgrades. Some island upgrades cost money and island points.

**Island Upgrades:**

- Island Member Limit: Allow more people to join your island
- Crop Growth Speed: Increase how fast crops grow on your island
- Island Border Size: Increase the size of your island
- Chunk Hopper Limit: Increase how many chunk hoppers can be placed on your island
- Available Island Chests: Increase how many `/island chest`s your island has access to
- Unlimited Flight: Allow everyone on your island to fly without limits
- Slayer Enchantment Upgrade: Increase the activation chance of the slayer enchantment

- Island Warp Limit: Increase how many island warps can be created on your island
- Auto Plant: Automatically replace crops after they are harvested
- Unlock Crops: Unlock the ability to farm certain crops on your island
- Cobblestone Generator Level: Allow your cobblestone generators to generate better ores

### Island Value & Island Top

Going old school, you're island's value is based off of value blocks! Value blocks must be placed down on your island to
count towards your island's value. They can be purchased from the `/shop`, or obtained from `/crates` or `/mines`. In
addition to island value blocks, spawners will also contribute value towards your island.

Island top is based solely off of island value. View the leaderboard with `/island top`.

### Hoppers & Chunk Hoppers

We've overhauled vanilla hoppers. You cannot craft hoppers, but they can be purchased from the `/shop` or won from
`/crates`. There are different tiers of hoppers, each moving a greater amount of items per second up to 800 items/sec.
Chunk hoppers behave similar to hoppers, but they will automatically pick up any item in the chunk that they're placed
in. You can customize what chunk hoppers pick up via `/island settings`.

### Ranks

There are five ranks with distinct perks.
