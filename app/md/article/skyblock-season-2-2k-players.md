# Static Skyblock - 2,000+ Unique Players

Author: Sam (Founder of Static Studios)

## This is a Huge Milestone for Static Studios

I am proud to announce that Static Skyblock has seen more than 2,000+ unique player joins throughout season 2.0! At
Static Studios, our goal is to create the absolute best content possible for our players. To achieve this, we believe
in building our content from the ground up. All content, whether its builds, gameplay features, etc... has been
custom-made for Static Skyblock. This requires an immense amount of up-front effort, but it is clearly paying off!

## What's next?

This is just the beginning for Static Studios, and for Static Skyblock. We have been working very hard over the past few
months on a new gamemode, which will be releasing in the near future. In addition to this new gamemode, we've been
working on Skyblock Season 3.0. This next season of skyblock is going to bring many changes and new content to the game.
While I won't spoil much here, I will say that it is going to be a huge improvement over season 2.0. If you thought
season 2.0 was good, just wait until you see season 3.0! As always, be sure to join our discord for more frequent
updates!
